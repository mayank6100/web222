By studing web 222 i am expetised in making web forms and web pages  web222 is the best course that i choosed in my life in this course i learned skills how to make a website and how to make web pages, web forms and how to work with java and html.After studying this subject it increase my ability to make website and web forms. I found responsive techniques such as fluid properties and other web tools which reduce the work and tools like codepen and codeply helps to view how a website will appear on different screens which really make the job easier SO, the course has ended very well and it was great fun to learn web development .Before studying WEB22 I didn’t find web developing interesting then after studying I am getting more interest in this and might pursue my career in this field .Moreover, the professor’s lecture actually helped a lot in understanding various concepts in HTML,CSS,Js. Moreover, sources like our course WEB222.ca and MDN reference also helped a lot in achieving good grades. </p>
